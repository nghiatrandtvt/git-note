git status: (git status -s "to see the short format")
	- git will compare the files from WORKING DIRECTORY and STAGING AREA. If it sees any file with difference content, it will display as "modifiled" and "file unstage". If it see any new file (file does not exist in staging area), it will display as untracked file. If it see file is deleted (file exist in staging area but does not exist in working directory), it will display as deleted.
	- git will compare files from STAGING AREA and LOCAL REPOSITORY. If it sees any file with difference content, it will display as "modifiled" and "file stageD, already to commit". If it see any new file (file does not exist in local repository), it will display as added file. If it see file is deleted (file does exist in staging area but exist in local repository), it will display as deleted.
	
git init:
	- git init <directory> or git init . will transfer regular <directory> to git directory with .git/ inside.
	- git init --bare will create a "local remote" repository-liked without the working tree, only have .git/. We can not manipulate regular work on that. Used for another repository to push or fetch.
